arcfit-bezier-spline-qcad
=========================

A rudimentary script to arcfit bezier splines, written in coffeescript against the QCAD Script API.

Nothing in this is super complex math wise, just a bit of fun with vectors.

The goal of this project is to write understandable code, not speed-efficient code.  This is why there is a glut of functions everywhere because functional programming f-yeah.
